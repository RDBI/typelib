# Typelib is a way of checking and converting data. It operates as a "filter
# chain" system which allows it to gradually normalize disparate data into a
# common type. Each chain is optionally a part of a list which allows it to
# provide several paths in a single external execution.
#
# The library is arguably very simple and therefore has simple requirements and
# needs. This is intentional.
#
# Please see TypeLib::Filter and TypeLib::FilterList for more information.
